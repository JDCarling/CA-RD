Working on our WIX website code
I am an architect trying to create forms for my clients to fill out and then it sends them a copy of the report and send me one while saving it in my wix code database. 
The sendgrid API only send one third of the email form people fill out on my page. it cuts off randomly.
I would prefer to not use sendGrid to send the email but it is the only way I have found thus far.
